Hair Color Enigma - Classical Solution

This module implements the classical solution to the "Four Hair Colors" enigma
where N people must guess their own hair colors using the parity strategy.
The implementation generalizes the solution for any number of people.

Each person can only see the hair colors of people in front of them, and
each can only say one word ("orange" or "indigo") to represent their guess.
